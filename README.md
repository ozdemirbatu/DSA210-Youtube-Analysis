# DSA210-Youtube-Analysis
I spend a significant amount of time on YouTube, whether it's for learning new things or simply unwinding and having fun. From tutorials to entertainment, YouTube has become an integral part of my daily routine. This project is my attempt to explore and analyze how I engage with the platform and uncover meaningful patterns in my viewing behavior.

My interests are diverse, and my watch history reflects that. Some of the content categories I enjoy include:

- Gaming: Gaming content is a big part of my YouTube time.
- Food: Cooking tutorials, recipe videos, and food reviews.
- Sports: I follow NBA and football, both for the latest updates and highlights of memorable games.
- Psychology: Videos that dive into the human mind, behavior, and self-improvement topics fascinate me.
- Technology: News, reviews, and deep dives into the latest tech advancements keep me informed.
- Music: My playlists are full of hip-hop and electronic music, and I enjoy exploring new tracks and remixes.
  
Through this project, I aim to understand how my interests translate into viewing habits. I hope to identify:

- My Most-Watched Genres: What type of content takes up the most screen time?
- Viewing Patterns: Are there specific times when I’m more likely to watch educational content versus entertainment?
- Personal Trends: How do my preferences evolve over time?
This analysis will not only provide insights into my habits but also serve as a way to reflect on my screen time and make more intentional choices about my content consumption. Plus, it’s a fun way to combine my personal interests with data science!  



## Dataset

The dataset is extracted from my personal YouTube watch history using Google Takeout. It contains:

- Video Titles: Names of the videos I’ve watched.
- Timestamps: The exact time each video was watched.
- Categories: Types of content, such as music, education, or entertainment.
- Devices Used: Information on whether I watched on a phone, computer, or TV.

The raw data is processed and cleaned to remove duplicates and irrelevant entries, resulting in a structured format suitable for analysis.


## Project Idea and Plan
### Project Idea
This project aims to analyze my YouTube watch history to uncover trends and patterns in my viewing habits. By examining my personal data, I intend to explore what types of content I consume the most, identify my peak activity times, and gain insights into how my preferences reflect my interests in gaming, sports, food, technology, music, and psychology. The project combines data analysis and visualization techniques to transform raw data into meaningful insights.


### Project Plan
Data Collection and Preparation:

- Extract watch history using Google Takeout.
- Clean and preprocess the data to remove duplicates and format it for analysis.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Identify the most-watched genres and categories.
- Analyze time-based trends (e.g., viewing activity by time of day and day of the week).
- Explore relationships between content types and viewing behaviors.


Visualization:

- Use bar charts, heatmaps, and word clouds to represent trends and insights visually.


Insights and Reporting:

- Summarize findings to better understand my content consumption patterns.
- Highlight areas for improvement, such as balancing entertainment with educational content.

Future Work:

- Expand the analysis to include data from other platforms.
- Explore predictive modeling to forecast future viewing preferences.

This approach ensures a structured exploration of my YouTube habits while also showcasing key data science skills.
