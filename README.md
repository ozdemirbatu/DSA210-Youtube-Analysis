# DSA210-Youtube-Analysis
This project explores my YouTube watch history to uncover trends in content preferences, viewing patterns, and activity times. Using data from Google Takeout, Iâ€™ll perform exploratory data analysis, create visualizations, and identify behavioral insights. The project showcases personal habits while building technical skills.
